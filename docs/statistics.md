## Usage statistics collection in Simple Browser

By default, Simple Browser sends some statistics about how it's used. Currently, these include:

* Your operating system and computer language
* When you installed Simple Browser
* The version of Simple Browser that you're using
* How often you use certain features in Simple Browser
* An anonymous ID representing your installation of Simple Browser

Collecting this data allows us to prioritize which devices and operating systems we test and which features we work on.

Simple Browser does not send:
* Anything that can be used to personally identify you
* Any browsing history, passwords, or other data stored locally in Simple Browser

If you want to opt-out of statistics collection, you can do so by going to the preferences page within Simple Browser and de-selecting "send usage statistics".
